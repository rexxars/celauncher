Codename Eagle Launcher (CELauncher) is a small application made to handle the cneagle:// protocol.
This allows you to click a link to join a Codename Eagle server, such as the ones on the servers page on Codename Eagle Nation (http://codenameeagle.net/servers/).
It should also let you join servers via links given through other means, such as through instant messaging clients etc.

It was made in an effort to make Codename Eagle more accessible - I personally find the whole Gamespy experience a pain in the ass.

Written in C# because I wanted to give it a try.
It doesn't do anything scary. It just launches Codename Eagle.
